## Usage

The type set is open and extensible: the CLI does not enum-check `relationships[].type`, so any kebab-case value passes `story validate`. Prefer a type from this reference when one fits; when none does, coin a descriptive kebab-case type (e.g. `former-supervisor`) and use it consistently on both sides.

Relationships are bidirectional. When adding a relationship to one character, add the inverse to the other:

- If A has `type: parent` to B, then B has `type: child` to A
- If A has `type: mentor` to B, then B has `type: student` to A
- If A has `type: rival` to B, then B has `type: rival` to A (symmetric)

Inverse pairs:
- parent <-> child
- grandparent <-> grandchild
- uncle or aunt <-> nephew or niece (either gendered inverse is valid, e.g. uncle <-> niece)
- mentor <-> student
- employer <-> subordinate

Symmetric types (same both ways):
- sibling, spouse, partner, friend, ally, rival, enemy, adversary, cousin, colleague, foil, confidant, love-interest, former-supervisor
